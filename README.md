### Calculate the winner!
There are two teams, Team OG and Team Alliance, playing a computer game competition. They will compete against each other in 3 rounds. The winner with the highest score wins the trophy!

Your task is:
- Calculate the average score for each team using the data given to you below 
**Data**
Og's score are 96, 108 and 89. 
Alliance score are 88, 91 and 110.

- Compare the two teams average scores to determite the winner of the competition and then print that to the console. Dont forget that it can be a draw, so test for that aswell. (Draw means they have the same average score).

**Bonus 1:** Include a requirement of a minimum score of 100. With this rule a team only wins a round if it has a higher score then the other team AND at the same time a score of atleast 100. Hint: use a logical operator to test for minimum scores aswell as multiple else-if blocks. Use the data below for this task. 
**Bonus Data**
Og's score 97, 112 and 101. 
Alliance score 109, 95, 123.

**Bonus 2:** Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw can only happen when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise no teams wins the trophy. Use the data below for this task. 
**Bonus Data 2:**
Og's score 97, 112 and 101. 
Alliance score 109, 95 and 106.

Good luck! Do the Bonus step if you have time, they are not mandatory but a great way to challenge yourself!
